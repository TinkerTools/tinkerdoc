Quasi-Internal Frame
====================

   Global frame *g* and QI frame *i* of atoms 1 and 2. The z direction of the QI frame is chosen along the distance vector.

Two common transformations used in Tinker are:

   - From (A) *Local Frame* (in which parameters are provided) to (B) *Global Frame* (in which the calculation is carried out).
   - From (A) *Global Frame* (for direct pairwise electrostatics) to (B) *Quasi-Internal (QI) Frame* (for optimized algebra), as shown in :numref:`fig-qiframe`.
